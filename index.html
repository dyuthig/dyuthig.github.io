    <p><em>Cricket</em> is a <strong>bat-and-ball game</strong>. Two teams of 11 player play on a field. The center of the field is a 20 meter (22 yard) pitch, which is where the batters hit and the bowlers throw. It also has 3 wickets on the ends of the pitch. Cricket is played all over the world.</p>
    <p>Cricket is played all around the world in countries like India, Australia, South Africa, England, and more! It is very popular!</p>
    
    <h2>Rules of Cricket</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>There are at least 1 innings where each team will take turns batting and bowling/fielding.</li> 
      <li>The fielding team will have a bowler bowl the ball to the batsman from the other team. The batsman tries to hit the ball with his or her bat to get runs for his or her team. </li>
      <li>The fielding team tries to get the batsmen out in many ways like hitting the wickets with the ball when bowling, catching a batsman's shot on the full, hitting the batsmanâ€™s leg in front of the wicket (LBW), or hitting the wickets before the batsmen can run to the other end of the pitch.</li>
      <li>The batsman will try to score as many runs as possible before getting out by hitting the ball and running from wicket to wicket before the fielders hit the wicket with the ball. Each time a player runs from one end to another, it equals one run. Hitting the ball to the boundary equals four runs. When the ball is over the boundary, it equals 6 runs. </li>
      <li>The fielding team must get 10 batsman out or end the overs before they can change over an stard batting. </li>
      <li>The goal of the gane is to score as many runs as possible before the opposite team gets 10 wickets. The team with the most runs wins. </li>
      <li>In the case of a tie,a super over will be played.The team with the most runs in the super over will win.</li>
      <li>2 batsman play at the same time on the field. Once a batsman gets out, another batsman will take his or her place. This keeps happening until 10 batters get out. </li>
